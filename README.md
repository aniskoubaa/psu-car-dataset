# The PSU Aerial Car Images Dataset

This dataset provides a collection of labeled aerial images of vehicles taken from drones in the campus of Prince Sultan University. 

The PSU dataset was collected from two sources: an open dataset of aerial images available on Github repo 
`Aerial-car-dataset, available online on: https://github.com/jekhor/aerial-cars-dataset`

and our own images acquired after flying a 3DR SOLO drone equipped with a GoPro Hero 4 camera, in an outdoor environment at PSU parking lot. The drone recorded videos from which
frames were extracted and manually labeled. Since we are only interested in a single class, images
with no cars have been removed from the dataset. The training/testing split was made randomly.
